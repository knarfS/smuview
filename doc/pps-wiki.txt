This page documents the config keys are various other info needed to write a libsigrok frontend for controlling programmable power supplies.

== TODO ==

* Some way to specify fixed values for voltage and current, for devices that have one or more of these fixed in some channels. Two options:
** A boolean key _FIXED, per channel
** A _MIN corresponding to _MAX: When set to the same as _MAX, denotes a fixed setting for that channel. This would also allow negative values, for e.g. a range -5V - 5V
** TODO: This is no longer a problem?
* Over temperature protection: need some examples of whether this is ever something that is gettable/settable, or is only ever a hardware feature.
** Seems like the Rigol DP800 driver implemented this as a gettable/settable feature

== Notes ==
It's not unusual for different channels on a device to have different voltage or current limits. Therefore, channels will generally be in a probe group which allows setting these limits.

After setting SR_CONF_CHANNEL_CONFIG, the limits of these channels may change, and the limits should be queried again.

== Config keys ==
A libsigrok driver for a programmable power supply implements all or some subset of the following config keys.

=== SR_CONF_POWER_SUPPLY ===

Denotes a device that provides power output via one or more output channels, typically with voltage and current set via the sigrok driver.

=== SR_CONF_VOLTAGE ===

* double, representing voltage.
* get: The current output voltage. This may not be the same as what was set -- the output may be disabled, or can change depending on the load.
* set: NA
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_VOLTAGE_TARGET ===

* double, representing voltage.
* get: The previously set target output voltage, or device default.
* set: Set the target output voltage.
* list: Supported voltage range as (low, high, step).

=== SR_CONF_CURRENT ===

* double, representing current.
* get: The actual output current. This may not be the same as what was set -- the output may be disabled, or can change depending on the load.
* set: NA
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_CURRENT_LIMIT  ===

* double, representing current.
* get: The previously set output current limit, or device default.
* set: Set the output current limit.
* list: Supported current range as (low, high, step).

=== SR_CONF_OUTPUT_FREQUENCY ===

* double, representing frequency.
* get: The actual output frequency for AC power supplies. This may not be the same as what was set -- the output may be disabled, or can change depending on the load.
* set: NA
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_OUTPUT_FREQUENCY_TARGET ===

* double, representing frequency.
* get: The previously set output frequency, or device default.
* set: Set the output frequency.
* list: Supported frequency range as (low, high, step).

=== SR_CONF_ENABLED ===

* boolean
* get: Actual state of output
* set: Turn output on or off
* list: NA

If a channel/probe group cannot be enabled or disabled separately from other channels, setting this key will return SR_ERR_NO. The set should then instead be tried with a NULL probe group, for devices that have only a global setting for this (TODO: check if this is still true!).

=== SR_CONF_CHANNEL_CONFIG ===

* string (e.g. "Independent", "Series", "Parallel", "Track1", "Track2")
* get: The channel output mode (e.g. independent, series or parallel)
* set: Set the channel output to independent (the default), series, or parallel.
* list: Supported channel modes.

=== SR_CONF_REGULATION ===

* string ("CV", "CC", "UR")
* get: The actual output regulation, e.g. constant current or constant voltage
* set: NA
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_OVER_VOLTAGE_PROTECTION_ENABLED ===

* boolean
* get: TRUE, when the over voltage protection is enabled.
* set: Enable/disable over voltage protection.
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_OVER_VOLTAGE_PROTECTION_ACTIVE ===

* boolean
* get: TRUE, when the over voltage protection threshold was reached.
* set: NA
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_OVER_VOLTAGE_PROTECTION_THRESHOLD ===

* double, representing voltage.
* get: Actual over voltage protection threshold.
* set: Set over voltage protection threshold.
* list: Supported voltage threshold range as (low, high, step). (TODO: Implement!)

=== SR_CONF_OVER_CURRENT_PROTECTION_ENABLED ===

* boolean
* get: TRUE, when the over current protection is enabled.
* set: Enable/disable over current protection.
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_OVER_CURRENT_PROTECTION_ACTIVE ===

* boolean
* get: TRUE, when the over current protection threshold was reached.
* set: NA
* list: NA

=== SR_CONF_OVER_CURRENT_PROTECTION_THRESHOLD ===

* double, representing current.
* get: Actual over current protection threshold.
* set: Set over current protection threshold.
* list: Supported current threshold range as (low, high, step). (TODO: Implement!)

=== SR_CONF_OVER_TEMPERATURE_PROTECTION ===

* boolean
* get: TRUE, when the over temperature protection is enabled.
* set: Enable/disable over temperature protection.
* list: NA
