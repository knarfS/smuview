ToDo clang-tidy
---------------

- Unify readability-implicit-bool-conversion (AllowPointerConditions) -> " == nullptr" and " != nullptr"
- readability-redundant-member-init.IgnoreBaseInCopyConstructors = 1 not always working!
- src/ui/datatypes/doubledisplay.hpp 	void setup_ui(); // TODO: widgets::MonoFontDisplay also has setup_ui()
- src/ui/datatypes/basewidget.hpp Q_SLOTS redesign?
- src/ui/datatypes/doubledisplay.hpp: setup_ui() override, b/c of widgets::MonoFontDisplay.
- bugprone-narrowing-conversions: Maybe use boost convert_to<>() -> see util.cpp, format_time_minutes()

ToDo Release
------------

- Python binding for save CSV

ToDo Scope
----------

- Fix ConfigKey sample_rate in UInt64Property::change_value(const QVariant qvar)

ToDo
----

- Use util::Timestamp?
- last_value_, min_value_, max_value_ -> std::atomic!
- Plot: Sampling
- Mutex for aquisition_state_?
- Save all data (gnuplot, octave, ...)
	- add a saveutil.cpp
- Configurable:
	- default check for getable/setable in get/set functions without assert(false)?
	- add button to sink/source/demodmm/measurement-ControlViews to control non default config keys.
	- Check getable/setable/listable also in the properties
	- Enhance ThresholdControl widget (e.g for re:load pro). Maybe a dedicated property?
		- Dedicated SvDoubleSpinBox and SvBoolButton?
- Breeze icons action/labplot-* for plots?
- Get fixed quantity signals from channel(/channel group) (q/qf/u is set in ch.meaning at the beginning). Implement in sigrok!
- Implement something like ch.meanings for config keys in sigrok, so smuview known the quantity/unit of config keys.
- Start timestamp on_update() -> device ctor -> timestamp = .0
- Start timestamp to session
- Use new connect/disconnet variant whenever possible.
- Use connect(obj, SIGNAL, SIGNAL) when possible (UIProxy/UIHelper)
- Lookup: std::atomic, std::condition_variable, std::mutex
- Remove "const Session &session" form ui::devices::* ctors and more??
- Maybe: In all ctors "Session &session" -> "const Session &session"
- Resize the DockWidgets/Views to their best sizes (value panels minimum, plot views max, ...). Maybe with QMainWindow->resizeDocks, SizePolicy in QDockWidget does not work....
- boost::stacktrace, see pv
- BaseDevice open()/close(): move aquisition stuff to HardwareDevice, move VirtualDevice stuff to BaseDevice
- util.cpp: use cmath instead of math.h, but Timestamp is boost and only works with non std::?
- Use AnalogBaseSignal in all(?) Channel classes, in View classes and in Plot classes
- Remove Configurable and ConfigKey from data::properties::*
- Session: shared_ptr or reference?
- Missing msvcr100.dll (Windows Server 2016) SmuView/PulseView
- DeviceTree: Button for expand/close all
- Plot: Add gradient (dY/dX) to diff marker in plot marker box
- Plot: Movable polt marker box. Maybe not possible b/c of missing stuff in qwt?
- Plot: Highlight polt marker and plot marker box when mouse over (near by for marker)
- Plot: Class for marker -> qwt curve tracker playground
- SequenceView: Handle headers (order of columns, time abs/rel) in CSV
- SequenceView: Handle units (ms, s, h, ...) in CSV
- PlotView: Make resolution and dpi configurable when saving as image
- Implement AnalogXYDataSignal (for python automatisation)? See scope support?
- MonoFontDisplay/PowerPanelView: To small for neg. values (esp. W/Ah/Wh with 6632B). B/c of the decimal point?
- Remove LCDDisplay?
- Reduce/Simplyfy BaseDevice name methods
- Bindings: Implement add_math_channel()
- Can we inherit MathChannel from UserChannel?
- Unify name of static (const) variables
- Remove devicetab.hpp time_unit_
- Cycle: replace BaseChannel::parent_device_ with device_id_, and so on....
- main.cpp: Remove while loop.
- AnalogTimeSignal: Move signal_start_timestamp_ to BaseSignal
- *Signal: Clean up Signal classes
- Add a way to change a channel/signal name in the GUI. Connect BaseSignal::name_changed() signal.
- Add a way to change the plot curves that have a default color to the new default color configured in the PlotConfigDialog. E.g. with a singleton to connect a dialog to multiple curves from different plots.
- Use singleton for SettingsManager instead of static methods?
- Use deleteLater() instead of delete
- Add AddPlotCurveDialog with channel and signals.
- Manage axes in plot.cpp: Per Quantity and not per curve! Test: Remove all curves and add a new one....
- UiHelper/UiProxy: Remove tab_id?
- SettingsManager: Method for getting the QSettings object and maybe load an user defined QSettings-file.
- example_multiplexer.py: Checkboxes in control views don't change.
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl-Q -> Close App, Ctrl-W -> Close tab)
- Do we need:
	- BaseDevice::next_channel_index_ / USER_CHANNEL_START_INDEX
	- BaseDevice::next_configurable_index_ / CONFIGURABLE_START_INDEX
Done
----

- Check in connect.cpp if GPIB is part of build info (libsigrok -> backend.c)
- Everey device must have its own session:
	1. Performance: With one sessions the aquisition functions are processed in sequence.
		The HP 3478A f.e. takes for ever, and so the other devices to. There are NO parallel
		requests.
	2. Adding new device to a running session: Chicken/Egg problem! Dev->open() tries to
		start aquisition, but device is not added to session yet (cxx binding).
		session->add_device() tries to start aquisition, but device is not opened yet...
	3. Solves the sr_session_source_add_internal() dublicate key problem.
	4. Propably use the multidevice API functions from linux gpib in scpi_libgpib.c

- Better detection of common_time_data_ (when in frame). Who is this possible when in
	init_signal() and not afterwards when in feed_in()
- QIcon (On/Off/Dis) -> Led: State(On/Off), Mode(En/Dis)
- ValueControl implement is_value_setable_/is_value_getable_ and disable/enable controls
- Save signals as CSV
- Math channels (for Power, resistance, Wh, Ah)
- Correlation between time bases (common, same count+fixed diff, "random") in (Analog)Data
- Configurable:
	- list_config
	- default check for listable in list function without assert(false)
	- Remove unused specific functions
	- min/max/step in views when not listable
	- Add functions for datatypes -> determin what list_* function to use
	- make the sink/source/demodmm/measurement-ControlViews more generic
	- signals for controls (views) to work with processing
	- Cache stuff
	- Missing sigok::ConfigKey::OFFSET
	- get_mq / set_mq problem with template?
	- Move is_controllable() to tab/view? Make more generic... -> Generic is_controllable() function, and specialized function in viewhelper.cpp
- namespace src/data/datautil.hpp
- Refactor ui class members CamelCase -> _ _ _
- Replace all "    Q_OBJECT" with "	Q_OBJECT" (4 spaces -> 1 tab)
- Replace other "    " -> "	" (4 spaces -> 1 tab)
- Autoscale plot. Plot doesn't always auto-update scale (rlp without load)
- Remove "hp3478a" from gpib_libgpib_name_ and list all available names.
- DataView: Add toolbar with "StayAtBottom" switchable action.
- Remove all items in combo box when parent has changed and setup_ui() is recalled?	see ConfigKeyComboBox and ConfigurableComboBox
- Refactore:
	- src/data/datautil.cpp -> src/data/
	- src/devices/deviceutil.cpp -> src/data/
	- src/devices/properties/ -> src/data/
- DataView: add signal (into this table) action
- static unsigned int device_counter; is changing
- License headers are not the same
- Session: move init to main.cpp
- Bindings: Binding for setting the color of a plot curve
- Bindings: Set name for new signal? e.g. f(x, y, name=nullptr)
- Add "E" for detecting energy (Wh) channels
- ValueDisplay SLOTS: CallByRef &?
- Connection dialog thread
- BaseChannel::add_signal(), L. 156, Korad PSU TODO
- Save session
- Segfault when closing/disconnet devices via UI/DevicesView

Won't fix
---------

- QWT Multiaxis
- Refactore:
	- src/data -> src/signals
- src/data/properties/* on_value_changed(gvar) -> on_value_changed(const gvar)
- *.hpp: virtual f_name() = 0; -> virtual f_name() = nullptr;



libsigrok
=========

- Add GPIB address to libgpib:conn as paramenter
- Re:load Pro: when acquisition is running and we send a command (e.g. "set xxx"), there are 2 listeners (1st send_cmd() (<-serial_write_blocking) and 2nd handle_new_data() (<-serial_read_nonblocking))
	- Make devc->acquisition_running thread safe, bool is NOT thread safe!
- Re:load Pro: when 2 responses are send fast afer each other, serial_read_nonblocking reads them both and the \r\n gets in beetween
- Re:load Pro: sometimes only a ^M is send from the rlp
- Re:load Pro: Sometimes the responses are mixed up (2 listeners??, Re:load Pro not keeping up??)
- Re:load Pro: how to clear otp_active and uvc_active?
- hp3478a: device isn't closed after stopping acquisition
- scpi-pps: protocol.c -> scpi_pps_receive_data() uses double, but output (e.g. analog) and DF_ANALOG receivers use hardcoded float. Using sr_analog_encoding.unitsize and .is_float to define the datatype (and size) (.unitsize = sizeof(double) (or by lurchi_: .unitsize=8 + float is double)) in the receiver functions!
- dev_acquisition_start() has to do first measurement (3478a, scpi-pps, reload(?)), because 1. DF_HEADER, 2. trigger measurement
	- If not: 3378a use scpi_cmd_resp() for use of mutex (wrt+read);
- Can't add 2x scpi_libgpib devices: scpi_libgpib.c -> scpi_gpib_source_add() calls session.c -> sr_session_source_add() with fd = -1. This calls session.c -> sr_session_fd_source_add() with key = GINT_TO_POINTER(fd) and finally throws an error in session.c -> sr_session_source_add_internal() because "Event source with key %p already exists."
- scpi-pps: when in acquisition send one write ":MEAS:VOLT?;:MEAS:CURR?" instead of 2 writes when possible
- Add channel.meaning.mq, channel.meaning.mqflags, channel.meaning.unit (+channel.fixed) to PPU and load channels, to make it easy to init signals in smuview
- Add missing units: sigrok::Unit::DECIBEL
- scpi-pps/hp66xxx: Return always TRUE for OVP_ENABLED
- hp3478a: spec_digits and enc_digits are used in the wrong way!
- Fix UserDevice::open() and ::close() -> virtual in BaseDevice and empty in UserDevice

WIP
---

- Change key naming (see load + psu wiki pages)

Done
----

- Re:load Pro: send "monitor 0" when device is scaned to stop eventually running monitoring and version can be read properly
- Re:load Pro: send "monitor 0" when device is closed
- Wrong string to float/double conversion (because of locale settings):
	- dmm/m2110.c: 2x sscanf((const char *)buf, "%f", &val) == 1 -> sr_atof_ascii((const char *)buf, &val) == SR_OK
	- motech-lps-30x/protocol.c: sr_atod(devc->buf, &dbl)
	- dmm/metex14.c: sscanf((const char *)&valstr, "%f", result) -> sr_atof_ascii((const char *)&valstr, result)
	- scpi/scpi.c: sr_atod(response, scpi_response) -> sr_atod_ascii(response, scpi_response)
- hp3478a: acquisition doesn't stop (sigrok-cli/smuview must be killed)
- Tests for convertion (st_ascii_tod) for locale "bugs"
- use mutex around ibwrt() and ibrd() (scpi_libgpib.c) per device, so they are thread safe
- use mutex around scpi_cmd_resp() and scpi_cmd() (helpers.c), so when a request has a response, they are thread safe.
- Mutex of scpi/helpers.c:
	- find all ocurrence of (sr_scpi_send_variadic(), sr_scpi_send(), scpi_cmd(), scpi_cmd_resp(), rigol_ds_config_set(), ....) and check if thread safe
	- Any functions missing, that need the mutex
	- Valid for SCPI over something something?
- Mutex of scpi_libgpib: Add to other transport variants (serial, tcp, ...), if so is the mutex in scpi/helpers.c enough?
- scpi-pps: add otp/ovp/ocp to pps_profiles[] (or to channel(group)) for HP 663xx
- HP3478A: Implement SPoll,
- Add missing confg key sigok::ConfigKey::OFFSET
- Provied SR_DF_META packets for the Re:load Pro and the HP3478A for changed values/states (e.g. output switched on/off, ovp, otp, ...)
- Add mqflags (AC/DC) to channel_group_spec for scpi-pps
- scpi-pps/hp66xxB: Don't send SCPI_CMD_REMOTE and SCPI_CMD_LOCAL when GPIB is used. Will result in error 602.
- scpi-pps/hp66xxx: Check if SPoll is faster than sending *STB? / FAULT?, if so implement and use SPoll (or SRQ) when using GPIB.
- scpi-pps's have channel groups but options/keys/_lists_ (voltage_target, ...) apply to device
- Add missing units: sigrok::Unit::JOULE, sigrok::Unit::AMPEREHOUR, sigrok::Unit::COULOMB
- HP-3478A: R4W -> R2W not working

Won't fix
---------

- Re:load Pro: Don't use "monitor 200", Instead "read" values every aquisition cycle with serial "read line blocking" and use a mutex around every read, write and write+read
- Add missing units: sigrok::Unit::(HECTO)PASCAL



Doku
====

- Link API to the psu and load wiki pages



Re:load Pro Firmware
====================

- Add "output" command (returns "on" / "off") to determin in wich state the output is (git commit 448cf71, 558bc0e (part))
- Send "on" / "off" when output state was changed at the device directly
- Send "uvlo xxx" when undervoltage threshold was changed at the device directly (git commit 224ab62)
