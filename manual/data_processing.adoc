SmuView can process and combine channels via math channels.

One example this could be used is, when you measure a current via the voltage
drop over a shunt resistor with a DMM. With the multiplication of a constant
factor and the voltage signal of the DMM you can generate a current channel with
the correct values in the correct unit (Ampere).

This types of math channels are currently implemented:

. Multiplication of two signals.
. Multiplication of a signal and a constant factor.
. Division of two signals.
. Addition of a signal and a constant value.
. Integration of a signal over time.
. Moving average of a signal.

As an alternative to math channels, you can use <<smuscript,SmuScript>> to do
far more complex signal processing.
